    <P>Dynamic Financial Fraud Detection Framework Using Machine Learning And Datamining Techniques</P>
    <p>Fraudulent financial statements (FFS) are the results of manipulating financial elements by 
        overvaluing incomes, assets, sales, and profits while underrating expenses, debts, or losses. 
        To identify such fraudulent statements, traditional methods, including manual auditing and 
        inspections, are costly, imprecise, and time-consuming. Intelligent methods can 
        significantly help auditors in analyzing a large number of financial statements. In this study, 
        we systematically review and synthesize the existing literature on intelligent fraud detection 
        in corporate financial statements. In particular, the focus of this review is on exploring 
        machine learning and data mining methods, as well as the various datasets that are studied 
        for detecting financial fraud. We adopted the Kitchenham methodology as a well-defined 
        protocol to extract, synthesize, and report the results. Accordingly, 47 articles were selected, 
        synthesized, and analyzed. We present the key issues, gaps, and limitations in the area of 
        fraud detection in financial statements and suggest areas for future research. Since 
        supervised algorithms were employed more than unsupervised approaches like clustering, 
        the future research should focus on unsupervised, semi-supervised, as well as bio-inspired 
        and evolutionary heuristic methods for anomaly (fraud) detection. In terms of datasets, it is 
        envisaged that future research making use of textual and audio data. While imposing new 
        challenges, this unstructured data.</p>
